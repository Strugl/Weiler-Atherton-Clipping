### Rust Realisation of Weiler–Atherton clipping algorithm

[Weiler–Atherton clipping algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weiler%E2%80%93Atherton_clipping_algorithm) is a polygon-clipping algorithm. 
It is used in areas like computer graphics and games development where clipping of polygons is needed. It allows 
clipping of a subject or candidate polygon by an arbitrarily shaped clipping polygon/area/region.
